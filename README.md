# blinkingLEDs


A basic project and code for beginners starting to work with the Arduino UNO board. The code blinks the three LEDs in a pattern and can be modified in various ways - change the timing, the pattern, or add LEDs. The project is a good start for those just beginning to tinker with coding electronics.
